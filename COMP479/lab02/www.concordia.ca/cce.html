Reader, let me introduce you to Big Data. Big Data, meet Reader. Actually, there's a bit more to it than that. Big Data systems involve a wide range of technologies that can only be understood when you master the underlying technical concepts. And that's why you need this course. Here, you'll learn about the basic technologies required to develop Big Data analytics solutions and deploy them at scale. You'll spend some time with the concept of virtualization and you'll have an overview of programming techniques for big data analytics. Once you've finished this course, you can take a moment to congratulate yourself before you dive into even bigger data on the path to completing your certificate.
Basic knowledge of SQL, Python and/or R is highly recommended. If you do not have knowledge of Python, we recommend that you take CEBD 1100 Introduction to Python and Data Analysis.

So, you had your introduction to Big Data, then you learned all about analytics. Now it's time to look at the systems you'll need to manage all that data and make sense of it. In this course, you'll review the state-of-the-art infrastructures used for high-performance storage and processing of data. You'll study distributed systems like Hadoop, NoSQL database systems like Mongo DB, as well as clusters and clouds, like Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure. You'll also use programming models like Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark to leverage those systems. If technical talk like that gets your heart racing, this is definitely the course for you. It's also the last course you'll need to earn your Big Data Certificate. Don't stop now, you're almost there!

<b>Me, myself and I.</b>
If you're someone with a very limited knowledge of French, we've got one word for you: "bienvenue." You've come to the right place. This course will help you learn to speak about yourself: who you are, what you like and don't like, where you're from, etc. And because conversation is a two-way street, you'll also learn to ask people about themselves and improve your ability to understand their answers. In simple terms, you'll learn the basics of getting by and that alone will open up whole new experiences for you here in Montréal.

This course is a great way to help you:
•	Follow simple instructions and give simple descriptions;
•	Describe yourself in detail and ask others about themselves;
•	Become more spontaneous when speaking;

•	Broaden your academic, social and professional horizons.

Let's face it, some people are intimidated by museums and galleries. They don't know how to approach a work of art, how to interpret it. They might even be afraid to say something that sounds silly, or worse, stupid. Thankfully, there are people in the museum to help them develop their ability to better understand and appreciate art. And you might be one of them. But first, you'll need to complete this course. All of the guides at the MMFA have and we're confident you will, too. This course will challenge your vision of the traditional role of a guide in an art museum and give you the tools to offer visitors meaningful learning experiences. If you want to help bring art to life, this course is a masterpiece.
*CNT*
This course is a great way to help you:
•	Understand the contexts in which the work of an MMFA guide occurs;
•	Reflect critically on the role and practice of a guide;
•	Identify multiple ways for interpreting works of art;
•	Research artists and objects in the MMFA collection using in-house and online resources;
•	Create a scenario as the basis for encounters with groups of visitors;
•	Facilitate group art interpretation that encourages observation, reflection, meaning-making, and dialogue; 
•	Contribute to ongoing collective learning amongst fellow guide recruits through mutual support, shared responsibility and active participation.
*APP*
This is a blend of theory and active learning through  demonstrations, ongoing feedback, workshops, guest speakers, both in the classroom and in the galleries. Active, enthusiastic participation is one of the keys to success in this course.
*WHO*
•	Anyone who wants to help bring art to life in the MMFA.

*KEYB*
If you want something done, you've got to do it yourself, right? Wrong. 
Company resources are increasingly limited. And, as a manager, it’s possible you're constantly solicited and simply can't keep up. You know that teamwork and professional development are vital. So the next step to solving the resource crunch is delegation. Done properly, it's an asset to any organization. Sophie Lemieux’s workshop will explore the constraints and opportunities related to delegation. She'll teach you effective techniques and processes to mobilize employees and prepare them for their new responsibilities. The art of delegation is knowing how to control an outcome without falling into micromanagement and perfectionism and Sophie will show you how.
*CNT*
This workshop will empower you to:
•	Understand the importance of effective delegation;
•	Establish when and how to delegate properly;
•	Experiment with the dos and don’ts;
•	Build your own delegation plan of action, applicable immediately in your workplace.
*APP*
This workshop is based on an optimized practical approach that mixes active learning, self-assessment activities, demonstrations and individual exercises. In short, you’ll learn by doing and sharing. 
*WHO*
•	Employees.
•	Entrepreneurs.
•	Managers.
•	Project managers.
•	Self-employed professionals who want to grow their company.
•	Employers who want to give their employees a great learning opportunity that will contribute to the success of their organization. 

We're flexible. That means workshops can be customized for corporate groups and offered on the date of your choosing, in your office or in one of our campus locations.
